    "1. Implement the algorithm for breaking codes with a given basic structure. \n",
    "2. Explain the steps in an \"Inverview Grading Style\" with Jupyter Lab Text blocks demostrating and explaining the function as you go. \n",
    "3. These demonstrations, explanations, and code comments must demonstrate that you understand the code and what it is doing. \n",
    "4. After the basic implementation you will rewrite the code completely with your own improvements, or copy the basic code package and add new features. This will be your custom feature.\n",
    "5. IMPORTANT - in the first implementation you will keep all instructions, given comments in the code, and use the variable names and set up as given. For your custom feature you may remove these and make the code \"your own.\" ALL CHANGE must be explained in text - why did you change/make improvements? We should be able to see how you adapted the orginal code.\n",

    "\n",
    "This file contains a walkthrough of the RSA Encryption Algorithm. RSA is an acronym for the names of the individuals that first publicly revealed the encryption scheme - Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in 1977. As described below, the overall effectiveness of this encryption scheme is based on the inability to factor large integers and the use of two different keys, a public key and a private key - in cryptology this is called Asymmetric Cryptography. \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this document, I will walk you through the steps of generating a public and private key as well as the process of encoding and decoding messages as well as the functions that make this possible. Additionally, I will walk you through how we can potentially break an encoded message using just a public key, but I will also explain how this is not always easily accomplished with today's computing power. I will also walk you through how I was ultimately able to complete this project and some of the issues I had along the way. Lastly, I provide a working version of the RSA Encryption Scheme allowing user interaction and an additional feature that imports the contents of a text file containing multiple encrypted messages.\n"

    "    * The function will test to ensure that the product of these numbers exceeds 256. In order to avoid issues with encryption and decryption, we want to target a modulo value that exceeds the max value of our encrypted messages. As we will see below, the message values being converted are based on the ASCII table, on which the decimal values of characters range from 0 - 255. Consequently, there are 256 total decimal values. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    * If a modulo value below 256 is detected, the function will end and require that the function be reran with different values of p and q.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. In order for the RSA algorithm to work, the public key value 'e' and the product of (p - 1) * (q - 1) must be relatively prime, meaning the greatest common divisor (gcd) of these two values is 1.\n",
    "    * I have the function defined so that it will randomly select a value for e. Values of 'e' typically range from 3 to 65,537 - certain values can be more efficient in exponentiation and there are different points of view on the security aspects of larger values. However, to keep in the spirit of smaller numbers, I've limited it to 31.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    * After a value for 'e' is randomized, the Euclidean Algorithm is called using the values of 'e' and (p - 1) * (q - 1) to test if the gcd of these two values is 1. If it is not, a new value of e will be generated and the Euclidean Algorithm will be called again. This will continue until a gcd of 1 is reached.

    "##### ***Private Key Generation Background***\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as with the Public Key Generation, let's get into a little of what drives this function. \n",
    "\n",
    "To start us off, the reason that RSA works is in part due to the concept of modular inverses. Recall that in our Public Key (e) generation function that we needed to identify a value of 'e' that was relatively prime to the product of (p - 1) * (q - 1). Since these two values are indeed relatively prime, there exists a modular inverse. This is what we will identify within this function - the modular inverse of 'e mod (p - 1) * (q - 1)'.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the function is called, these following main steps occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A variable 'd' is initialized with -1 (For purposes of loop control - see below)\n",
    "2. The value for (p - 1) * (q - 1) is calculated and assigned to the variable 'm'\n",
    "    * The value (p - 1) * (q - 1) is based on Euler's Totient Theorem.\n",
    "3. A while loop is implemented with the continue condition being that d < 0. This condition has been set as we do not want to return a negative modular inverse value. (This can cause issues with decryption as we want an integer value as the base)\n",
    "    * As the the loop is entered, the value assigned to 'e' and 'm' will be compared. From here, the Extended Euclidean Algorithm function 'EEA' is called. This function requires two arguments, with the largest of the two being called first - This is why the aforementioned comparison is carried out. See below for more information regarding the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.\n",
    "4. After the result of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm is returned. The Bezout Coefficient representing the modular inverse is extracted from the returned tuple.\n",
    "5. Once the function finds a suitable Private Key 'd', the value is returned."

    "##### **The Extended Euclidean Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Extended Euclidean Algorithm 'EEA' is a critical component in the generation of the private key. As mentioned above, the RSA Algorithm is dependent of finding a modular inverse of 'e mod (p - 1) * (q - 1)'. This is where the Extended Euclidean Algorithm comes in. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the EEA function is called, the values for the public key and (p - 1) * (q - 1) assigned to 'e' and 'm' within the 'Find_Private_Key_d' function, respectively, are passed into the function as arguments. The EEA will then carry out the process of identifying the Bezout Coefficients that will provide us with a linear combination where the Bezout Coefficients multiplied by the values of 'e' and 'm' will arrive at the gcd. Since we know the gcd must be 1 based on the Public Key Function above, the function is trying to find the following linear combination where s and t are the Bezout Coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "s * e + t * m = 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "When reading this combination, the modular inverse of 'e' in this scenario would be the value of 's' - This value is ultimately the key 'd' that we can use as the private key.\n",

Without these values, one could not calculate the  (p - 1) * (q - 1) value used in determing the modular inverse of 'e'. As we will see below in the code breaking section, it can be very difficult to find the prime factor's that produced the modulo value used as part of the key.  \n",

As will be further explored below, the effectiveness of the RSA algorithm lies in the difficulty in factoring large prime numbers. In our example, the modulo value of '10403' would be broken rather quickly with only 5 digits. However, if the modulo value were in the hundreds of digits, it could take a long time to find the two prime factors that made of the modulo value. As we saw with the decode function above, the only inputs we need to 'recreat' the private key are the public key 'e' and the two prime numbers. So it is paramount to keep these values to yourself!"

    "##### ***Fast Modular Exponentiation (FME) vs the Basic Modular operator %***\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see above and as previously noted, the following expressions were used to find our encrypted and decrypted numeric values:\n",
    "\n",
    "* C = M^e mod n - Representing the encrypted value\n",
    "* M = C^d mod n - Representing the decrypted value\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as previously noted, we did not used the built in python syntax of 'a**b % c' in order to find the remainder of an exponentiated value. Instead, the FME function (Fast Modular Exponentiation) was used to determine the remainder of the two expressions above. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for using FME over the '%' operator is due to how python is performing the exponentiation of the base. Operator precedence requires that the exponentiation value is calculated first and then the modular operator is applied. In the event of small exponent values, these will not make much difference in the time to complete the calculation, but as the value of the exponent increases, python has to increasingly perform more layers of multiplication, which can ultimately take a very long time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, FME will only have to perform a limited amount of steps to get to the remainder. At a high level, FME simply converts the exponent value into it's binary equivalent, if the value translated to it's binary equivlanet value is 1, the previously accumulated modded value is multiplied by the next squared value in the binary expansion. I've added an edited version of the FME function below, which counts the number of 'operations' that python has to perform. Using arbitrary numbers of 5 as the base, 250 as the exponent and 13 as the modulo value, we see that this set of numbers results in 52 steps (or operations) that are performed in the loop. Now, if we had used the % operator as in '5**250 % 13, this should result in 250 operations (249 occurrences of 5 x 5 and the a modulo operation % on the result). Just with this small example, we can see FME can much more efficiently reach the modular result. As RSA uses very large values as exponents for the private and public keys 'e' and 'd', respectively, FME is the preferred method for modular exponentiation.\n"

This allowed me to keep all of the functions independent of the functions used above as required. Additionally, I've implemented a function that can read a text file containing multiple code breaking examples from students on Piazza and can break the codes and read off all of the messages in one function call. Lastly, I've added validation checks for all user inputs, making heavy use of the try, except structure. This program contains a menu that will accept user input and will remain active until the user decides to quit the program. See below for the application!  I've included an example run of each option the user can pick from to showcase each option. Note that I've included a copy of the output in the subsequent cell in case the application gets ran again."
